# Grand Slam Offers

*“Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.”*

Travis Jones

I was 23 years old and, to quote Ruth from Ozark, I didn't know “shit about fuck.” But there I was, in a Las Vegas penthouse hotel room along with ten business owners learning about marketing and sales… in my most-fashionable “beast mode” t-shirt (a shirt I had gotten for free, and one of the five shirts I owned at the time).

Truthfully, I was anxious, self-conscious, and thought I was making a huge mistake. I had paid $3,000 of money I didn't have to get a seat at the table. I knew I needed to learn. Everyone there had a business . . . except me. I was planning on starting one, a gym.

TJ, the organizer, had multiple successful businesses. While going over the agenda, I remember he made an off-hand comment about making $1,000,000 that year.

One. Million. Dollars. I was spellbound. *I wanna be like this guy. I’ll do anything.* The problem was, I didn't know what any of them were talking about. KPIs? CPLs? Conversion rates? My head was spinning as I pretended like I knew what they were talking about. But I didn’t, and I’m bad at pretending.

Between “sessions,” TJ found me. He could tell I was in way over my head. TJ was kind, curious, and caring. After a little bit of small talk, he asked me a simple question that changed my life forever . . .

“Do you want to know the secret to sales?”

I had never sold anything in my life. I had never even read a book on it. I had just recently learned what the term meant (seriously). I leaned forward, intent to download every syllable he spoke right into my brain.

I opened my notepad and stared at him with intent. I was ready for *the* secret.

He looked at me soberly and said: “Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.”

I nodded, wrote it down, underlined it, and circled it. And with that, my entire worldview of selling was transformed.

My mind began racing. I didn't have to be skilled . . . or even any good. I just had to come up with things that *anyone* would say yes to. The greatest game of my life had begun.

**What This Book Is About**

At some point, every successful business owner was a *wantrepreneur*. A person full of ideas and frustrated at having potential to spare. Something clicks when they realize the horrible trade they (and so many people) make *―* trading their freedom for (falsely) perceived security.

Their discomfort compounds. And once the discomfort of staying the same surpasses the discomfort of change, they take the leap. *I’m going to be an entrepreneur so I can be free. Free* *to do whatever I want, whenever I want, with whomever I want.*

Some learned about entrepreneurship through personal development.

Others got into it through a franchise.

Others bought courses.

And some just said, “F*CK IT. I’m doing it. I’ll make it work.”

And made it work they did.

Most of us open up shop with the intention of helping people in some way. Many times, this assistance is in some way related to something that’s affected us personally. We set out to “give back” by providing value to others by helping them solve a problem that once plagued us. Then again, sometimes this isn’t our way in. In either case, we cling to the dream of making more and being freer than we are now.

Many of us thought, naively, that owning a business would be our crowning accomplishment — a final destination — when in reality, it was just the beginning.

Somehow, in the transition between “passionate to help others” and “owning my first business,” we gradually realized that we don’t even know the first thing about business, let alone turning a profit.

We may know a lot about our passion, about *why* we started the business, but that doesn’t mean we know anything about succeeding in business. Much to the disappointment of the idealists on the sidelines, succeeding in business means getting prospective customers to trade us money for our services. Our passion for their hard-earned coins. That’s the agreement. The only way to facilitate that exchange, to transact, to literally carry out business as a business *is by making the prospect an offer*.

**What’s An Offer Anyways?**

The *only* way to conduct business is through a value exchange, a trade of dollars for value. The offer is what initiates this trade. In a nutshell, the offer is the goods and services you agree to give or provide, how you accept payment, and the terms of the agreement. It is what *begins* the process of getting customers and making money. It is the first thing any new customer will interact with in your business. Since the offer is what attracts new customers, it is the lifeblood of your business.

*No offer?* No business. No life.

*Bad offer?* Negative profit. No business. Miserable life.

*Decent offer? *No profit. Stagnating business. Stagnating life.

*Good offer?* Some profit. Okay business. Okay life.

*Grand Slam Offer? *Fantastic profit. Insane business. Freedom.

This book helps entrepreneurs craft those Grand Slam Offers. These are the offers that are so effective, profitable, and life-changing that it seems they can only be the result of luck! That’s how it looks to an untrained eye, at least.

As you likely now know, I have crafted thousands of offers over the last decade. Most failed. Some did okay. And some struck gold . . . but I never *really* knew why. As Dr Burgelman, a famous Stanford business school professor said, it is far better to have understood why you failed than to be ignorant of why you succeeded.

But, as the data started rolling in, what seemed like “luck” and “fortune” was closer to a repeatable framework. I have been fortunate enough to have struck gold enough times to document these frameworks and have gotten “lightning to strike twice.”

I have put the steps and components of those frameworks in a logical and digestible format so they are actually useful. Today. Like now. I’m giving you action. Instead of a sad-but-typical book of vague business theories and mental masturbation.

**The Two Main Problems Most Entrepreneurs Face and How This Book Solves Them**

Although you *can* make the list of problems you face a mile long, which is a great way to stress yourself out, all these problems typically stem from two big kahunas:

Seems obvious, right? It costs more money and time to get more clients, thereby solving issue one, and that money is coming from the profit margins, which creates problem two! What’s more annoying, prospects savagely compare and belittle our services in favor of cheaper and crappier alternatives — with the cheapest one “winning.” This, of course, when “winning” means getting to work more for even less (sad face).

Let’s say you’ve slashed prices to get more customers. You may even have a full client load. But here you are, barely making it because profit margins are too thin. “Competition” becomes a race to the bottom.

If you’re struggling with one or both of these issues, you’re not alone. I’ve been there.

Heck, I think *every* entrepreneur has these same challenges.

I also want you to know that it’s not your fault. Typical models weren’t designed for profit maximization. They were designed by companies who have boatloads of funding and can operate at a loss for *years*. When these models are used in the real world, business owners just barely “get by.” They essentially “buy themselves a job” and work 100 hours a week to avoid working 40. Crappy trade. My guess is that if you’re anything like me, you signed up for something better.

Keep an open-mind. The contents of this book, if executed, can transform your business . . . fast.

It’s okay if you’re not into money numbers or business models. I’ve done all that work for you. I’m walking you through the process step-by-step in these pages. I’m going to explain each of the big two problems we touched on above in detail, including why they don’t work. Then I’m going to show you the solutions. And to wrap this adventure up, I’ll explain how to enhance value to maximize how much you make per customer, so that you can outmarket everyone and stack cash.

We use this offer model for every niche we work with (chiros, dentists, gyms, agencies, plumbers, roofers, dog walkers, physical products, software, brick and mortar stores, and so many more), and it’s amazing how fast things can improve with each and every one of them when they use this framework.

**What’s In It For You?**

I’ve made every (dumb) business mistake in the book. Now, you can learn from my embarrassing, brutal, multi-million dollar fuck-ups without having to suffer the pain yourself.

Building these businesses has been a very hard and emotional journey for me. I wouldn’t trade these experiences for the world. However, if this book helps just one entrepreneur avoid suffering as I did, keep their business open, or accomplish their dreams, it will all be worth it.

If you are willing to exchange the time it takes to watch two episodes of your favorite tv show and really study this book — and if you *implement* even a single offer component — I can guarantee you will add more clients and more dollars to your bottom line. Reading this book, and taking it to heart, will be the single best return on time for your business. Nothing else will allow you to do what this book can do in the same amount of time. That is a promise.

As a side benefit — implementing a new offer is about one of the easiest things to do in a business. So you really *can* do this. This isn't some management practice or culture building hoodoo. This is the real “how you sell shit for lots of money”-type stuff.

**What’s In It For Me?**

I give all these materials (this book, the accompanying course, and all other books and courses which you can find at *acquisition.com*) for free or at cost in order to help as many people as humanly possible make more and serve more. And I have made these with the intention of providing more value than you can get from a $1000 course, any $30,000 coaching program, and hilariously more than a $200,000 college degree. And I do this because, although I could sell these materials in that format, *I just don’t want to*. I’ve made my money *doing* this stuff, not *teaching how to do* this stuff, contrary to most of the marketing community at large. So my model is different (I’ll explain more in a second).

That being said, there are two key archetypes I am looking to provide value to with my published materials. For archetype I, entrepreneurs *under* $3,000,000 per year in revenue, my goal is to help you get there and *earn your trust*. Try just a couple of tactics from this book, watch them work, then try a few more, watch them work . . . and so on. The more you see results in your own business, the better.

Once you succeed, you become archetype II, entrepreneurs *at minimum between* $3M - $10M in yearly revenue. Once you get there, or if that’s you now, I’d be honored to invest in your business and help you cross $30M, $50M, or $100M+. I don’t sell coaching, masterminds, courses, or anything like that. Instead, I have a portfolio of companies I take an equity interest in. I use the infrastructure, resources, and teams of all my companies to fast track their growth.

But don’t believe me yet...*we just met*.

If you’re curious, my business model is simple, just like the four-piece pyramid logo:

If you look carefully, the process reverse-engineers success. I think it’s pretty cool. Here’s how: I know these business owners can execute the frameworks I have without hand-holding, and therefore, would be very likely to succeed with the next set of frameworks (getting to $30M, $50M, $100M looks different than getting to $3-$10M). They know that my style works for them, because it already has. So we operate on shared trust - I trust they can execute, and they trust that our stuff works - again, because it already has….all while helping everyone else….fo’ free. So it allows me to preemptively avoid failures and dramatically increases success likelihood. Let me show you how much….

At the time of this writing, every business I have started since March of 2017 has achieved a $1,500,000/mo run rate. According to the Small Business Administration, the odds of a single business even achieving $10M/year in revenue are .4%, or 1 in 250. Having it happen four times in a row is .4% x .4% x .4% x .4%= very very low probability that it was luck. As such, I can say with conviction that we know how to recreate success using the frameworks I share over and over again. They work because they are timeless business principles.

I actively visualize, every day, how it felt to wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats, wondering how I’d make payroll. That gut-wrenching “meditation” keeps me hungry as an entrepreneur but also grateful for my security and peace of mind. I want the latter for you and anyone else that gives a damn about what they do.

Fair enough?

Cool. So let’s get to it.

**Basic Outline of This Book**

This book is intended to be a resource. As a resource, I mean it will be something you will read through and then keep in your tool box, coming back to it again and again. Why? As Einstein says, “never memorize anything you can look up.” Business is not a spectator sport. You’re not cramming for some midterm, and you’re not some limp-wristed philosopher.

You do work. And to work, you need tools. This, my friend, is one of those tools.
