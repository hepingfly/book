# Free Goodwill

*“He who said money can’t buy happiness, hasn’t given enough away.”*

Unknown

People who help others (with zero expectation) experience higher levels of fulfillment, live longer, *and* make more money. I’d like to create the opportunity to deliver this value to you during your reading or listening experience. In order to do so, I have a simple question for you...

*Would you help someone you’ve never met, if it didn’t cost you money, but you never got credit for it?*

If so, I have an ‘ask’ to make on behalf of someone you do not know. And likely, never will.

They are just like you, or like you were a few years ago: less experienced, full of desire to help the world, seeking information but unsure where to look….this is where you come in.

The only way for us at acquisition.com to accomplish our mission of helping entrepreneurs is, first, by reaching them. And most people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover (and it’s reviews). If you have found this book valuable thus far, would you please take a brief moment right now and leave an honest review of the book and its contents? It will cost you zero dollars and less than 60 seconds.

Your review will help….

….one more entrepreneur support his or her family.

….one more employee find work they find meaningful.

….one  more client experience a  transformation  they otherwise  would never have

encountered.

….one more life change for the better.

**To make that happen...all you have to do is….and this takes less than 60** **seconds….leave a review.**

*PS - *If you feel good about helping a faceless entrepreneur, you are my kind of people. I’m that much more excited to help you crush it in the coming chapters (you’ll love the tactics I’m about to go over).

*PPS -* Life hack: if you introduce something valuable to someone, they associate that value with you. If you’d like goodwill directly from another entrepreneur - send this book their way.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.

- Your biggest fan, Alex
