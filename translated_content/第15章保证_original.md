# Enhancing The Offer: Guarantees

*“You’re gonna like the way you look...I guarantee it.”*

**Men’s Warehouse ad that ran forever.**

The single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is...drum roll...*risk.* Risk that it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do for them. Therefore, reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive. You will want to spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it. That being said, how much more attractive can a guarantee make an offer?

Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing the quality of the guarantee. It’s that important.

From an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees:

You must *always* hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.

**But won’t people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?**

Sometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and your refund percentage *doubles* from 5 percent to 10 percent, you’ve still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that all goes to the bottom line.

Ex: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales

Guarantee Offer 130 sales, 13 refunds (10%)= 117 Net sales

117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)

Don't be emotional, just do the math. For a guarantee to *not* be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100 percent offset by people who refunded. So an absolute increase in sales of 5 percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in refunds of 5 percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely). So, for the most part, the stronger the guarantee, the higher the *net* increase in total purchases, even if the refund rate increases alongside it.

Warning: While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy *because* of guarantees can become very shitty customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success with your product or service. In a world where you want to reverse risk *and* get customers the best outcome possible, tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties.

**Pro Tip: High Cost Services Warning**

If you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI guarantee, as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling.

**Types of Guarantees**

What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.

To give a guarantee *teeth* you have to decide what you’ll do if they *don’t* get the result.

Without the “or what” portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted.

**Note**: This is what most marketers do.

Bad Example: We will get you 20 clients guaranteed.

Better example: You will get 20 clients in your first 30 days, or we give you your money back + your advertising dollars spent with us. This is a simple, but strong guarantee.

Here are the four types of guarantees. I’ll go over them in theory then we will apply them.

**1) Unconditional Guarantees**

As I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and “anti-” guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees. They're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you *will* have some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.

**2) Conditional Guarantees**

Conditional guarantees include “terms and conditions” to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on. In general, you want these to be “better than money back” guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a *very* powerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those part of the conditional guarantee. In a perfect world, 100% of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but will have achieved their result, and therefore will not want to take it. That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just fyi - if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the outcome.

**3) Anti-Guarantees**

Anti-guarantees are when you explicitly state “all sales are final.” You will want to own this position. You must come up with a creative “reason why” the sales are final. Typically, you’ll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your part that a consumer could immediately understand and think “Yes, that makes sense.” These types of guarantees are especially important with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.

**4) Implied Guarantees**

Implied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare, profitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I don’t get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of “If I do a great job, I will be very well compensated.” These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that you will get compensated when you do perform.

**Stacking Guarantees**

An experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually *stack* guarantees. For example, you could give an unconditional 30 day no questions asked guarantee then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back 90 day guarantee. That would be an example of stacking an unconditional with a conditional guarantee.

You can also stack two conditional guarantees around different (or sequential) outcomes. For example, you’ll make $10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1, 2, and 3. This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for achievement). Doing this shows the prospect you are serious about getting them results and convinced that they will achieve what they want. This shifts the burden of risk back from them onto us...a very powerful strategy.

Let’s go through some different guarantee examples:

**Guarantee: If you don’t achieve X, in Y time, we will [insert offer] . . .**

**[Unconditional] “No Questions Asked” Refund Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **A) a full refund, B) a 50 percent refund, C) a refund of their ad** **spend and any ancillary costs incurred, D) you pay for a competitors program instead, E) you return their money plus an additional $1,000 (or other applicable amount)

**My Take: **This is about as simple as it gets. It’s also very risky. You put yourself in a** **situation where if someone does not achieve the results, whether because of your fault or not, you will still be held accountable. Obviously this is a strong, but unoriginal guarantee. You can add conditions, but the more conditions you add, the faster this guarantee loses its teeth.

**Wording: **I heard Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, pitch his unconditional** **guarantee on a webinar and I thought it was unbelievable. These are 100% his words and not my own. I take no credit for this but have included it for completeness.

*“I’m not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that’s when you decide to keep it. If it’s not for you, no hard feelings. You will then, after signing up at URL be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn’t for you. But you can’t make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it. And know this...whether it’s 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain’t happy, I ain’t happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you’re happy. All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell use “gimme my money” and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support request average 61min over a 24/7 time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up at URL you’re getting exactly what you need to BENEFIT.”*

**Pro Tip: Name Your Guarantee Something Cool**

If you are going to give a guarantee, spice it up. Instead of using “satisfaction” or some other “vanilla” word, describe it more strongly.

**Generic Example **(Bad): 30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee.

**Creative Imagery Example #1 **(Good): In 30 days, if you wouldn’t jump into shark** **infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you paid.

**Creative Imagery Example #2 **(Great): You’ll get our famous “Club a Baby Seal** **Guarantee”After 30 days of using our services, if you wouldn’t club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don’t have to pay a penny.

**[Unconditional] Satisfaction-Based Refund Guarantee (Expanded from above):**

**What the Client Gets: **If at any time they're not satisfied with the level of service they're** **receiving from you, they can request a refund (at any time) for the program.

**My Take: **Believe it or not, this was my guarantee when I sold weight-loss programs.** **Besides being an irresistible offer, I guaranteed satisfaction. I used the strength of my guarantee to close a lot of deals. “Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm *not* guaranteeing you’re going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I’ll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.”

It works perfectly with a best-case/worst-case close. “Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed *not* to help you is walking out of here today.” If you are good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge. That line made me a lot of money. I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years.

Satisfaction/No questions asked is the highest form of guarantee. It means we could do everything right and you could still ask for your money back. As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and faster closing on the sales side. *But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises.* If not, steer clear. I believe this offer works much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of fulfillment.

**Pro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type**

Bigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B2C businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time). The higher the ticket, and the more business oriented it is, the more you want to steer towards specific guarantees. That may or may not include refunds, and may or may not have conditions.

**[Conditional] Outsized Refund Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **Double or Triple their money back, or a no-strings-attached** **payment of $X,XXX (or another amount that’s far more than what they paid).

**My Take: **This is for when you sell something with high margins. And this is a guarantee** **to add *with* a consumption condition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world class affiliate marketer Jason Fladlien (who did $27M in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said “if you buy this course and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000 no questions asked.” He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a $2997 course. What’s more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales. That’s what a crazy guarantee does for you.

In general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need a *lot* of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there’s a low chance of the result not being achieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform a traditional 30-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).

**[Conditional] Service Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.

**My Take: **This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time. It essentially** **guarantees they will achieve their goal, but it eliminates the element of time. You are never at risk for losing the money. The guarantee is around the outcome. To add further flavor to it, you can make this guarantee conditional on them doing key actions linked with success: setting up a web page, attending calls, showing up to workouts, weighing in, reporting data, etc.

Real Talk: Since I have been advising businesses to use this particular guarantee, I have yet to have a single person say a client took them up on it. Realistically, if someone actually does everything you asked them to do and doesn’t achieve the result by the time you had said, one of two things usually happens:

Also, it’s likely the sales conversation with the guarantee was months earlier. What may have been important in the sales conversation is a distant memory now, replaced by their affection towards you/your business.

**[Conditional] Modified Service Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You give them another Y-long period of service or access to your** **product/services free of charge. Generally, Y should give them at least twice the duration.

**My Take: **This is like the service guarantee, but it ties a specific duration to your extended** **work/involvement. So instead of being on the hook “forever,” you’re only on the hook for an additional Y period of time. I’ve seen it work magically and keep the business on the hook for a more finite period of time which may be an easier place for you to start before doing the “all out” Service Guarantee above.

**[Conditional] Credit-based Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You give them back what they paid but in a credit toward any** **service you offer.

**My Take: **This is best used during an upsell process to seal the deal on a service they are** **unsure they will like. They already like what they have, you are trying to sell them *more* of that. Worst case, they can apply it to the thing they already like. So it maintains goodwill with the customer.

**[Conditional] Personal Service Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You work with them one-on-one, free of charge, until they reach** **X objective or result.

**My Take: **This is absolutely one of the strongest guarantees in existence. It’s like a service guarantee on crack. You will *definitely* want to add conditions, though: they must respond back in twenty-four hours, they must use the products you tell them to, they must XYZ. Only if they do that, will you keep working with them one-on-one.

This is especially powerful as you scale and become more edified as a business owner. Can you imagine one of my sales people saying, “Alex will personally work with you until your offer converts”? Right. It would work. It would also be a nightmare. So I would probably put contingencies like, “Provided you've already spent $10,000 on your existing offer using our structure, the offer you ran was for lead generation, and it was a free offer. These are things that would make it unlikely they would not succeed. If for some reason they *hadn’t* with those stipulations in place, I could probably fix their problem in ten minutes just looking at it.

**[Conditional] Hotel + Airfare Perks Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **If you don't receive value, we will reimburse your product** ***and your*** **hotel + airfare.

**My Take: **This is technically a “refund of ancillary costs” from our first example. I just** **love it a lot for workshops and in-person experiences. Normally the event would cost more than the hotel and airfare, so it's like adding an extra $1000 to a guarantee but way more tangible. It’s original enough that people like it.

**[Conditional] Wage-Payment Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You offer to pay their hourly rate, whatever that may be, if they** **don’t find your call/session with them valuable.

**My Take: **This is also an ancillary cost guarantee, just a very original one. If someone ever** **actually asks for the wage payment, just ask them for their tax return and divide it by 1,960 (number of working hours at 40hrs/wk for a year). But no one asking for a refund will actually do that, so you will never actually have to give one of these out. Like ever.

**[Conditional] Release of Service Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You let them out of their contract free of charge.

**My Take: **This voids a commitment or cancellation fee. If you have a business that has** **enforceable commitments, contracts or clauses, this can be a powerful guarantee. Better yet, if you are in a business that does not enforce your contracts, then you have nothing to lose by adding the guarantee.

**[Conditional] Delayed Second Payment Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You won’t bill them again until** ***after*** **they make or get their first** **outcome. Ex: Lose your first five pounds . . . make your first sale . . . get your website live, etc.

**My Take: **I like this a lot, especially if you have a very systematized process for getting the** **first result. It gets the prospect thinking in fast action terms and gets them moving. It will also focus your team on activating your client. This is a great one when you know what metric or action drives activation (predicting indicator of long term retention) of a client.

I’ve successfully used this guarantee loads of times.

**[Conditional] First Outcome Guarantee**

**What the Client Gets: **You continue to pay their ancillary costs (ad spend, hotel, etc) until they reach their first outcome. Example: If you don’t make your first sale in 14 days, we will pay for your ad spend until you do.

**My Take: **Just like the delayed second payment, just centered around a different cost. I** **personally like this setup a lot. It keeps everyone focused on getting that first dollar over the bridge. Once that one comes across, the second comes soon after.

**[Anti-Guarantee] All Sales Are Final**

**What the Client Gets: **Access to super exclusive very valuable service/product. Likely,** **this is a very powerful thing that once seen cannot be unseen, or once used cannot be taken away. Example: a line of code to improve your checkout experience on a website. Once someone received this code, they could try and use it without paying you. Or a series of opening messages for picking up girls, or opening sentences for messaging cold prospects. Things that are very valuable but incredibly easy to steal after they’ve been seen/understood.

**My Take: **This can enhance the persuasiveness of the sale and the value of the product or** **service. It essentially *implies* that the client is going to use it and see an immense benefit thereby exposing the business to vulnerability. It acts as a damaging admission. We have an “all sales are final” policy, *but* that is because our product is so exclusive and so powerful that once used it cannot be unused.” Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy.

So instead of being wishy-washy, lean into the fact this thing works so well, and is so easy to copy, you *must* make all sales final. They’ll believe you even more if you take this position. “We are going to show you our proprietary process that we are using right now to generate leads in our business. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We’re going to be exposing the inner workings of our business, as a result, all sales are final.” Note: strong reason why is needed here. Just make one up that sounds compelling. The more you can show *real* exposure, the more effective this will be.

Anti-guarantees can also work very well with high ticket products and services that require a lot of work or customization. “If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin. If you are not serious, don’t buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing. ” From these examples, you should get the idea.

**Implied Guarantees: Performance Models, Revshares, and Profit-Sharing**

**Performance: **A) ...Only pay me $XXX per sale/ $XXX per show B) $XX per Lb Lost

**Revshare**: A) 10% of top line revenue B) 20% profit share C) 25% of revenue growth** **from baseline

**Profit-Share: **A) X% of profit B) X% of Gross Profit

**Ratchets: **10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z

**Bonuses/Triggers**: I get X when Y occurs.

**What The Client Gets: **If you do not perform, they do not have to pay. If you perform,** **your compensation has been determined based on an agreement decided upon *before* you begin working.

**My Take: **Performance, Revshare, and Profit-shares aren’t guarantees “per se”, but for all** **intents and purposes, they are. There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you dont make money, you don't have to pay me. In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to your clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers. Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters collaboration and a long-term relationship. I'm a big fan. The drawbacks are tracking and collection. So if you can find a way around that...you’ve hit a gold mine. This is a part of the offer we teach our agencies who use our software. We help them switch from a retainer model to a performance model and wrap that into the Grand Slam Offer I walked through earlier. I've seen countless agencies go from $20k/mo to $200k+/mo in a matter of a few months.

You can also pair a revshare or performance setup with a minimum. It would be like saying “we get the greater of $1000 or 10% of revenue generated.” So if the client doesn’t generate money because of whatever reason this at least covers your costs of services etc.

Or saying we get $1000/mo for the first 3 months, then after that, it switches to 100% performance. This would be ideal for a setup that takes a lot of time to get going.

These types of offers work well when you have quantifiable outcomes. The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment without performance.

**Create Your Own Winning Guarantee**

Reversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer. Experienced marketers spend as much time crafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves. It’s that important.

I have personally used all the guarantees listed above (except for the hotel and phone call one, which I just saw and liked). But you can come up with your own! The key is to identify a client’s biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. “What do they *not* want to have happen if they pay you? What are they most afraid of?” Reverse their fears into a guarantee. Think of the time, emotion, and outside costs associated with any program or service. The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the better.

That being said, guarantees are enhancers. They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer, but they cannot make a business. If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or a poor product, it will backfire into lots of refunds. No bueno.

My advice: Start selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships. This will make all sales final (so no fear from refunds). Most importantly, it will commit you to your customers’ results and keep you honest. From there, either keep that guarantee and scale (perfectly fine), or move up the food chain to less restrictive guarantees to increase volume.

We now have a core offer built and guarantees chosen.

**Next Up...**

Now all we have to do is put a bow on this puppy and actually name it. Naming an offer correctly determines how well your advertising converts, how big of a response you get from outbound emails/cold calls/texts, and how many inbound responses you get from organic comments.

It matters.

That being said, I will show you how to generate unlimited names or “wrapping paper” for your offer. That way it never fatigues, no matter how small your market may be. This is the key to evergreen lead generation.
