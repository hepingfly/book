# Pricing: The Commodity Problem

*“Think different.”*

Steve Jobs

“Grow or Die” is a core tenet at our companies. We believe every person, every company, and every organism is either growing or dying. Maintenance is a myth.

What this means is, if your company isn’t growing, it’s dying. This is a sobering reality for many of us. I learned the hard way, and my businesses suffered for a long time because of it.

Let me explain. The market is continuously growing. The stock market grows at 9 percent per year. If we aren't growing at 9 percent per year, we are falling behind. “Maintenance,” in the most generic sense, would be 9 percent growth year over year.

Furthermore, if you’re in a growing marketplace, then you might have to grow at 20-30 percent per year, just to keep up, or risk falling behind. So you can see how maintenance is a myth.

So, then,what does it take to grow? Thankfully, just three simple things:

That’s it.

Sure, there are lots of ways to acquire customers and zillions of ways to increase order value and purchase frequency, but, simply put, that’s it. Those are the only three ways to grow.

Example: If I sell 10 clients a month, and a client is worth $1,000 to me over their lifetime (through avg cart value x avg number of purchases), then my business will cap at $10,000/mo (10 x $1,000).

10 New Clients/mo x $1000 Lifetime Value = $10,000/mo max revenue.

If you want to grow, you’ve got to either sell more clients every month (while maintaining suitable margins) or have them be worth more (by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy). That’s it.

**Author Note - Only Two Ways to Grow**

To simplify this concept even more. There are really only two ways to grow: get more customers, and increase each customer’s value. “Increasing each customer’s value” has two sub-buckets: 1) Increasing profit per purchase 2) Increasing the number of times they buy. For the purpose of this book, I highlight both of those sub-buckets as individual growth paths. I did this because I think it will be easier to understand the money models that will come in Volume III. All three — getting more customers, increasing their average purchase value, and getting them to buy more — are repeated themes in this book. But if you seek simplicity, both increasing average purchase value and increasing the number of times a customer buys results in one outcome: increasing each customer’s value.

**Business Terms**

Before going any further, and to better flesh out the concepts that follow, we should take a second to define and better understand some key business concepts. When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my “beast mode” t-shirt I was clueless about such terms. Let me help you be better than, well, me.

**Gross Profit: **The revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an ADDITIONAL** **customer. If I sell lotion for $10 and it costs me $2, my gross profit is $8 or 80 percent. If I sell agency services for $1,000/mo and it costs me $100/mo in labor to run that client's advertising, then my gross profit is $900 or 90 percent. Note: This is *not* net profit. Net profit is what’s left over after *all* expenses are paid, not just the direct costs of fulfillment.

**Lifetime Value: **The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer.** **This is gross profit multiplied by the number of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer stays five months, and they pay $1,000/mo while it costs me $100 per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is $4,500.

Here’s the breakdown:

Revenue: ($1,000/mo * 90% Gross Margin * 5 months) = $4,500 Lifetime Value (LTV)

Note that the indirect costs, like admin, software, rent, etc., are not included in LTV.

**Note: **You will find different definitions for lifetime value depending on the** **source. The biggest difference is that some sources only count total revenue, while others focus on gross profit over the lifespan. I focus on gross profit. You may also see me refer to this as **LTGP Lifetime Gross Profit** in other texts for clarity’s sake.

**Value-Driven vs. Price-Driven Purchases**

This book was intended to be a textbook for any business that wants to *grow*. I’ve spent (and continue to spend) hundreds of hours on calls and in-person meetings consulting entrepreneurs on crafting their offers. I have seen the ones that take off into the stratosphere and those that fizzle.

Having a Grand Slam offer makes it almost impossible to lose. But why? What gives it such an impact? In short, having a Grand Slam Offer helps with all *three* of the requirements for growth: getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and getting them to do so more times.

How? It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace. In other words, it allows you to sell your product based on VALUE not on PRICE.

*Commoditized *= Price Driven Purchases (race to the bottom)

*Differentiated* = Value Driven Purchases (sell in a category of one with no comparison. Yes, market matters, which I will expound on in the next chapter)

A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it’s prone to purchases based on “price” instead of “value.” If all products are “equal,” then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if a prospect compares your product to another and thinks “these are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one,” then they commoditized you. How embarrassing! But really . . . it’s one of the worst experiences a value-driven entrepreneur can have.

This is a massive problem for the entrepreneur because commodities are valued at the point of market efficiency. This means that the marketplace drives the price down through competition until the margins are *just* enough to keep the lights on: “just enough” to become a slave to their business. The business makes “just enough” to justify the owner waiting anxiously for things to “turn around,” and by the time that lie is realized . . . they are in too deep to pivot (at least, until now).

A Grand Slam Offer solves this problem.

**But What Does A Grand Slam Offer Do?**

Alright, let’s start by defining a Grand Slam Offer.

It’s an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to *get paid* to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.

In other words, it allows you to sell in a “category of one,” or, to apply another great phrase, to “sell in a vacuum.” The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product *and nothing*. So you can sell at whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. As a result, it gets you more customers, at higher ticket prices, for less money. If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down like this:

Having a Grand Slam Offer increases your response rates to advertisements (aka more people will click or take an action on an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam Offer).

If you pay the same amount for eyeballs but 1) more people respond, 2) more of those responses buy, and 3) they buy for higher prices, your business *grows*.

I’ve “struck gold” on my share of offers. Not because I've got some superpower, but because I’ve just done this a lot of times (and failed even more). I sorted through the crap that chronically fails and pocketed all the stuff that reproducibly succeeds (and put it in this book) .

Here’s the key takeaway from all this: a business does the *same* work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam Offer). The fulfillment is the same. But if one business uses a Grand Slam Offer and another uses a “commodity” offer, the Grand Slam Offer makes that business appear as if it has a totally different product — and that means a value-driven, versus price-driven, purchase.

If you have a “commodity” offer, you will compete on price (having a price-driven purchase versus a value-driven purchase). Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and *think differently* to assess the value of your differentiated product. Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it’s too difficult to compare prices, which means *you* re-calibrate the prospect’s value-meter.

**Real Life Grand Slam Offer Money Math: Before and After**

Quick backstory . . . one of our companies is a software that advertising agencies use to work leads for their customers. Using this software, agencies transform their offer from a commoditized offer of lead generation services to a Grand Slam Offer of “pay for performance.” Let me show you the multiplicative effect it has on the revenue of the business.

**While rounded for illustration’s sake, these values are based on the real numbers a lead generation agency selling services to brick and mortar businesses experience**

**Old Commoditized Way (Price-Driven) — Race to the bottom**

**Commoditized Offer: **$1,000 down, then $1,000/mo retainer for agency services

**Breakdown:* ***At .5 to 1 return on advertising spend, you lose money getting customers. But in 30 days, those 5 customers will pay another $1,000 each, bringing you to $10,000 in total and break even. The next month, the $5,000 that comes in would be your first profitable month, and each month thereafter would be profitable (assuming they all stay).

This is an example of a commoditized service — normal agency work. There’s a million of them, and they all look the same. Commoditized businesses and offers have a harder time getting responses from ads because all their marketing looks the same as everyone else's.

**Note: **It all looks the same because they are all making the same offer.

*You pay us to work.*

*We do work.*

*Maybe you get results from that work. Maybe you don’t.*

It’s reasonable, but it’s easily duplicated (and subject to commoditization). *This* *commoditization creates a price-driven purchase . . .*

You are forced to be priced “competitively” to get clients *and* to stay that way to keep them. If the client sees a cheaper version of the “same thing,” then the value discrepancy will cause them to swap providers. This is a dilemma . . . lose this client, the rest of your clients, and potential clients, or stay “competitive.” Your margins become so thin they *vanish*.

Furthermore, it’s hard to get prospects to say yes (and *keep* them saying yes) unless you’re hypervigilant about clients commoditizing your business by staying “competitive.” And that’s the problem with the old commoditized way. They’re able to compare. Unless you switch to a Grand Slam Offer, your prices will keep getting beaten down. The business eventually dies, or the entrepreneur throws in the towel. No bueno.

We want to make an offer that’s so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product is different from everyone elses (which, if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation) and instead just have the offer do that work for you. That’s the Grand Slam Offer way.

Let’s dive in to see the contrast in sales numbers.

**New Grand Slam Offer Way (Differentiated, Incomparable) (Value-Driven)**

**Grand Slam Offer: **Pay one time. (No recurring fee. No retainer.) Just cover ad spend. I’ll generate leads and work your leads for you. And only pay me if people show up. And I’ll guarantee you get 20 people in your first month, or you get your next month free. I’ll also provide all the best practices from the other businesses like yours.

. . . and everything else you need to sell and fulfill your customers. I’ll give you the entire play book for (insert industry), absolutely free just for becoming a client.

In a nutshell, I'm feeding people into your business, showing you, exactly, how to sell them so that you can get the highest prices, which means that you make the most money possible . . . sound fair enough?

It’s clear these are drastically different offers . . . but so what? Where’s the *money*!? Let’s compare both in the below chart.

**Breakdown: **You spend the same amount of money for the same eyeballs. Then, you** **get 2.5x more people to respond to your advertisement because it’s a more compelling offer. From there, you close 2.5x as many people because the offer is so much more compelling. From there, you are able to charge a 4x higher price up front. The end result is 2.5 x 2.5 x 4 = 22.4x more cash collected up front. Yes, you spent $10,000 to make $112,000. You just *made money* getting new customers.

**Comparison: **Remember the old way, the way you lost half the ad spend up front?** **With the new way, you are making *more* money *and* getting *more* customers. This means that your cost to acquire a customer is so cheap (relative to how much you make) that your limiting factor becomes your ability to do the work you already love doing. Cash flow and acquiring customers is no longer your bottleneck because it’s 22.4x more profitable than the old model. Yup. You read that right. This is the part in the action movie where you walk away from an explosion in slow motion.

This is the exact Grand Slam Offer we used with our software business that serves agencies. The numbers can become wild . . . fast. I know 22.4x better sounds unreasonable, but that's the point. If you play the same game everyone else does, you’ll get the same results everyone else does (mediocre). You hit singles and doubles, keep the lights on, but never get ahead. But remember the opening passage of this book: that when you align all the pieces, you can knock it out of the park so well that you win *for good*. In my first 18 months in business, we went from $500k/year to $28,000,000/yr off of less than $1M in ad spend. So, when I say 20:1 . . . 50:1 . . . 100:1 returns, I mean it. When you get this right, the results are, well . . . unbelievable.

**Summary Points**

This chapter illustrated the basic problem with commoditization and how Grand Slam Offers solve that. This gets you out of the pricing war and into a category of one. The next chapter will focus on finding the correct market to apply our pricing strategies to. It’s one of the most important things to get right. A grand slam offer given to the wrong audience will fall on deaf ears. We want to avoid that at all costs. We must detour from pricing for a moment to learn what to look for in a market. It’s an essential box to check before continuing on our journey.
