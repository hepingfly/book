# Pricing: Charge What It’s Worth

*“Charge as high a price as you can say out loud without cracking a smile.”*

Dan Kennedy

*A picture of Gym Lords Summit 2019 for our highest level gym owners all sporting my trendy mustache.*

***January 2019.***

All I could see was black. My eyes felt glued shut. I was awake, but the fatigue in my temples felt like a five-pound weight was duct-taped to my skull, dragging my eyelids back down. I had to concentrate forcibly to open them.

The details of the dimly lit room beamed in. I rolled over to the edge of the hotel room bed, feeling each and every muscle in my body as my weight shifted. Hunched on my side, I could see my clothes scattered on the floor. I was so beat the night before that I didn’t even remember taking them off.

I had just finished a five-day gauntlet of keynote after keynote presentation. Two days of presentations for our highest-level clients immediately followed by spending two days planning with our entire company (135+ employees).

I had missed a FaceTime call from my father the day before. I didn’t have anything on my agenda for the morning. So I creakily got up, slid into a hoodie and some sweats, and walked into the hotel hallway to call him back. After the initial pleasantries, he immediately dove into why he was calling — parental concern.

“I saw the picture you posted of all your clients . . . ” he said, but in an unusually concerned tone. “I thought the event was for all your highest-paying clients? I didn’t know it was a big event. It looked like you had a thousand people there!”

Alone in the hallway and struggling to shake the heavy weight of exhaustion still, I tried to gauge where his concern was coming from and what he was getting at. I had explained this all to him already. “It was only for our highest-level clients, that wasn’t all our clients,” I said. “Just the ones who pay $42,000 a year . . . our Gym Lords, like I told you.”

“Every single person in that picture paid you $42,000?” He sounded almost frightened at the idea.

“Yeah, wild right?” My voice was hoarse from days of speaking and thousands of twenty-second conversations.

“Is it legal what you’re doing?” he asked. *Wow. That escalated quickly, I thought to myself.* “Do they know they’re paying you that much?”

“Yes, it’s legal. And of course they know. It’s not like magically siphoning money.” “That’s a lot of money. I hope what you’re giving them is worth it.”

I contemplated whether it was worth the effort to dive into this or just ignore it. But knowing this was going to be “a thing,” I took a deep breath and began to explain. “If I made you $239,000 extra this year, would you pay me $42,000?” I asked, using “$239,000” because it was the average increase in topline revenue of a gym using our systems for 11 months.

“For sure,” he said, “I mean if I knew I was going to make that back. But what would I have to do?”

“About 15 hours a week of work”

“And how long would it take me to make the $239,000?”

“Eleven months”

“And how much of the $42,000 would I have to pay you up front?”

“Nothing. Just pay me as you start making the money using the system”

I watched it click. My dad got it. “Oh,” he said, “well then, yeah, I would do it.”

“And that's why they do it, too.”

Making shit loads of money breaks people’s minds. It literally stretches their minds so far past what they believe is possible they assume you are doing something wrong or illegal. They literally “can’t even.”

Why? Because they think to themselves . . . *they can't be that much smarter than me or work* *that much harder than me, so how is it possible for them to make 1,000 times more than me? Enough money that it would take me literally ten lifetimes to make what they make in a year.*

In the three years leading up to me writing this book, I took home over $1,200,000/mo in profit. Every. Single. Month. That’s more than the compensation for the CEOs of Ford, McDonalds, Motorola, & Yahoo . . . combined . . . every year . . . as a kid in his twenties.

It angers those who believe life isn't fair. It confuses others who cannot comprehend and believe there must have been a mistake. And it inspires a select few, who are bound for greatness.

I hope that you are in the last category, because that is who I am writing this for.

You *can* do this.

You just need to learn *how*.

And I'm gonna show you.

**Price to Value Discrepancy**

*“I hope what you’re giving them is worth it.”*

Those words would probably sting for most, but when my dad said them to me, I just knew he didn’t understand the *value* we were providing. What I want to show you is how to create and communicate value, aka the “worth-it-ness” of an offer.

In order to understand how to make a compelling offer, you must understand *value*. The reason people buy *anything* is to get a *deal*. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth *more* than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE). The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs.

After all, as Warren Buffet said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.”

The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It’s also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business.

Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most — you can only go down to $0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to 1/10th compared to your competition, don't compete on price.

As Dan Kennedy said, “There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive.”

So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes *at a higher price* by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only *after *we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they still get a great deal (think* *buying $100,000 of value for $10,000). It’s ‘money at a discount.’

**Why You Should Charge So Much It Hurts**

Most business owners are *not* competing on price or value. In fact, they’re not actually competing on anything at all. Their pricing process typically goes something like this:

And the big secret: those competitors they are copying are dead broke. *So why on earth* *copy them?*

Pricing where the market is means you’re pricing for market *efficiency*. Over time, in an efficient marketplace, more competitors enter offering “a little more for a little less,” until eventually no one can provide any more for any less. At this point, a market reaches perfect efficiency, and the business owners participating make *just enough* at the end of the month to keep going. The bottom 10-20 percent of operators get washed out or lose the will to fight. Then fresh business owners enter with no idea and repeat the process of their forefathers. And around and around they go.

In plain words, pricing this way means you are providing a service at just above what it costs for you to stay above water. We are *not* trying to stay barely above water. We are trying to make egregious amounts of money that will have your relatives asking if what you are doing is legal. Again, we are not trying to get the most customers. We are trying to make the most money.

That being said, since there is no strategic benefit to being the second-lowest priced player in your marketplace. Allow me to give you a brief overview of why I see premium pricing as not only a very smart business decision, but a moral one. Furthermore, it’s the only choice that will allow you to truly provide the most value, a unique and strong position in the marketplace. Let me introduce you to the virtuous cycle of price.

**Virtuous Cycle of Price**

I have used this framework in most of the materials I release because it needs to be consistently reinforced. The forces of the marketplace will grate on your belief system. You must stay strong and ignore them! Here’s the basic premise of why you *need* to charge a premium if you want to best serve your customers.

When you decrease your price, you . . .

. . . Decrease your clients’ emotional investment since it didn’t cost them much

. . . Decrease your clients’ perceived value of your service since it can’t be that good if it’s so cheap, or priced the same as everyone else

. . . Decrease your clients results because they do not value your service and are not invested

. . . Attract the worst clients who are *never* satisfied until your service is *free*

. . . Destroy any margin you have left to be able to actually provide an exceptional experience, hire the best people, invest in your people, pamper your clients, invest in growth, invest in more locations or more scale, and everything else that you had hoped in the goal of helping more people solve whatever problem it is that you solve.

In essence, your world sucks. And to make matters worse, your service probably sucks because you are squeezing blood from the proverbial stone. There’s just not enough money left over to make something exceptional. As a result, you fall in line with the armies of average businesses that race to the bottom. I’ve lived that life. It’s terrible. If you love your customers and your employees, please stop short-changing them when there is a better way.

Here’s the reverse. This is what happens when you raise your prices.

When you raise your prices, you . . .

. . . *Increase* your clients’ emotional investment

. . . *Increase* your clients’ perceived value of your service

. . . *Increase* your clients’ results because they value your service and are invested

. . . Attract the *best* clients who are *the easiest* to satisfy and actually cost *less* to fulfill, and who are the most likely to actually receive and perceive the most relative value

. . . *Multiply* your margin because you have money to *invest* in systems to create efficiency; smart people; improved customer experience; scale your business; and, most importantly of all, to keep watching the number in your personal bank account go up, month after month, even with reinvesting in your business. This allows you to ultimately enjoy the process for the long haul and help more people as you grow, rather than burning out and shriveling into obscurity.

To swing the argument even further in favor of higher prices, here are a few interesting concepts. When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product. Wait, what? Yes.

**Higher Price Means Higher Value (Literally)**

In a blind taste test, researchers asked consumers to rate three wines: a low-priced wine, a medium-priced wine and an expensive wine. Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly, in order of their price, with the most expensive being the “best,” the second most expensive being “second best,” and the third, cheapest option, being rated as “cheap wine.”

What the tasters didn’t know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times. Yet, the tasters reported a wide discrepancy between the “high priced” wine and the “cheap” wine. This has deep implications for the direct relationship between value and price.

In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People *want* to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be slightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.”

That is how you create a category of one. In this new perceived marketplace, you are a monopoly and can make monopoly profits. That is the point.

One final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it *stings* a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win.

But I know this isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. Your product must *deliver*. So many wish to shortcut the real work. Do that and you *will* fail. In the real world, to have the “gonads” to charge big ticket prices, you must *outwork your self doubt*. You must be so confident in your delivery, because you have done it *so many times,* that you *know* that this person will succeed. Experience is what gives you the conviction to ask for someone’s entire year’s salary as payment. You must believe so deeply in your solution that when you look at yourself in the mirror at night, alone, your conviction remains unshakable. So let me bring this section home with my personal experience.

**My Premium Price Experience**

In my first niche consulting business — Gym Launch — I teach gym owners a better business model. Before productizing my consulting services, I flew out to 33 gyms in 18 months to do full turnarounds.

We would fly out, fix everything in the gym, and relaunch it in 21 days. We would average an increase in $42,000 in additional sales in 21 days. It was wild. My fee was the 100% of the revenue I would bring in.

At our peak, we were turning around eight gyms a month. This quickly became a logistical nightmare. After the wear and tear of living in motels month after month after month, I thought to myself *there has to be a better way to do this.*

One month, there was a gym we were scheduled to go fly out to. But, I simply didn’t want to do it. So I told them we were going to cancel the engagement. The gym owner practically threatened me to help him. So I said I would help him, but he would have to do all the work, but I would show him how.

Within thirty days, this gym had made almost $44,000 in new up front cash collected sales (4x their previous month). As soon as I saw that my process could be duplicated from afar, without me having to fly people in. . .our business exploded. I had found the missing link because my travel schedule was no longer a constraint. We went on to sell 4000+ more gyms over the next few years (and counting) using a *done-with-you* rather than a *done-for-you* model. But. . .back to premium pricing.

When I entered the space, low-price competitors offered full-service marketing for $500 per month, with a single high-price competitor charging $5,000 for his product.

I wanted to be the premium price leader. I wanted to be so expensive that it created allure around what we were doing. So, we came in at three-times the highest-priced player and 32 times more than the lower-priced players. A price of $16,000 for a 16-week, done-with-you intensive. Then we upsold 35 percent of those people into a three-year, $42,000/year agreement for us to help them grow their gyms.

For context: The average gym owner makes $35,280/year in take-home profits. If that’s the average, it means *half* make even *less* than that. So for many of them, they were committing to *half* of their yearly pay *or more* to buy our program. And I was selling this to grown men as a kid in his twenties, telling them I was going to help them make more money. This was possible because my conviction was stronger than their skepticism. *How?*

Based a voluntary survey taken at our last full company event, with 158 gyms responding, we found that a Gym Launch gym who has been in our program for 11 months will experience the following average improvements:

The survey just proved what I already knew. I had complete conviction in our product.

I knew it worked. I had *outworked my self-doubt.*

**Summary Points**

What should you take from this?

First and foremost, charge a premium. It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful. We were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were charging on a *fraction* of what our clients made using our system. This is important. Our clients still got a *deal*. The gap between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spin. We charged the most money. We provided the most value.

Our gyms remained the most competitive, made the most money, always had the latest and best acquisition systems, and had the support to implement them at lightning speed.

We made many mistakes along the way, but our pricing model was not one of them. It allowed me the room to make big bets without losing the farm. The truth is that 99 percent of businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them. Profit is oxygen. It fuels the fire of growth. You need it if you want to reach more people and make a bigger impact.

In order to charge so much, though, you must learn to create tremendous value. Let’s head there next.
