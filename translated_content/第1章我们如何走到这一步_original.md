# How We Got Here

*“Magic will find those with pure hearts, even when all seems lost.”*

Morgan Rhodes

***December 24, 2016. Christmas Eve.***

The room was pitch black. My shoes stuck to a floor covered in dried soda and crushed bits of candy. My nostrils were full with the smell of stale popcorn. We had showed up too late to get good seats and ended up pressed near the front of the theater. Just a few rows in front of me, the movie’s blazing projection occupied my entire field of view. In the reflected glow, I could see the outlines of Leila’s family’s faces. They may as well have been hypnotized.

I envied them. They sat, entranced, soaking in their paid time off for Christmas. *Must be* *nice.*

Anybody else would have missed it but Leila, my girlfriend at the time, knew me too well. Anybody else would have thought I was watching the movie, but Leila could tell I was staring blankly at the screen, my eyes not tracking the movie. My face was pale. My cheekbones and jawline appeared gaunt. Weeks of chronic stress had killed my appetite.

“What’s wrong?” she asked.

I didn’t answer.

She rested her hand on mine to get my attention. I didn’t react. Within moments, her fingers tightened around my wrist, and she looked at me, her eyes searching for mine. “Your heart is racing,” she whispered, concerned.

Without asking, she took my pulse.

It was 100 beats per minute. Nearly twice what it should be for a fit 27 year old male at “rest” in a cool, dark room.

“What’s going on?” she asked more forcibly, but still whispering.

The truth is, I was terrified.

*A few hours earlier . . .*

I looked like a giant. I sat scrunched up in a children’s miniature play chair. My knees almost touched my chest, even with my feet firmly planted on the old beige carpeted floor. My laptop felt hot sitting atop my steeply angled knees. Dolls and toys were scattered around me. They stared at me with wide eyes and toothy grins, motionless. I had been their entertainment the past few weeks.

I was in Leila’s parents’ house. They had recently become grandparents and used this spare bedroom as a playroom when the grandchildren visited. I didn’t have a place to live. So they were letting Leila and I stay there “as long as we needed.” They had let me use the children’s playroom as my office for my “business”, which at this point felt almost as make-believe as the stories they had told their grandchildren in this room.

I literally felt like I was playing dress up. Except the stakes were real. And this was my life.

My ears were hot and red from the phone being pressed against them for what felt like hours. I kept switching hands because my arms would tire from holding the phone up for so long.

“I’m sorry Mr. Hormozi,” the voice on the other end of the line said, “we have to hold onto these funds for the next six months. We’ve seen some irregular activity, so this is precautionary.”

“Are you fucking kidding me, $120-grand,” I said. “A ‘precaution’!?”

“I’m sorry sir, our underwriting team*―*”

“Yeah, I heard you,” I said, cutting him off. “I don’t accept that.”

“Sir, it’s not up to me it’s just our pol*―*”

“What am I gonna tell my salesman, who has a baby and another on the way? Are you going to tell him he’s not going to be able to buy his pregnant wife and newborn food? Are you going to pay his mortgage for him?”

I was seething.

“Sir*―*” he began again, with unphased apathy, just trying to deliver the news.

“It’s not yours to take.” My aggression was quickly turning into desperation. “Shit, just send me half so I can pay my employees,” I pleaded “It’s Christmas Eve for fuck’s sake.”

“Sir, we’re going to be holding onto the entirety of your funds for the next six months per your agreement . . . ” The voice faded into the distance.

*Fuck.*

I hung up and checked my accounts. *$23,036.*

I owed my salesman a $22,000 commission check for $120,000 in sales I never got.

Without wanting to give myself the opportunity to think about it, I wired it to him.

*-$22,000 Payment Successful.*

Balance $1,036.

*Fuck*

*I screenshotted this image of my bank account because I knew I would tell this story some day.*

The sunlight blinded me as we emerged from the matinee. Families shuffled in and out through the revolving doors, making their happy memories. I was in a daze. Leila led me to the car, her hand wrapped firmly around mine.

“What’s wrong? What happened?” she asked.

“The money isn’t coming.”

“What do you mean?” she asked. “It’s delayed?”

I exhaled in defeat. “They are keeping it all.”

“Can they do that!?”

“Apparently,” I said stoically, trying to maintain my composure in front of her parents.

“What are you gonna do about the commissions?”

“I already paid him. Everything.” I said it without looking at her.

Leila’s concern turned to dread.

We sat in silence the whole way home. I stared out the window. She held my hand in hers. It was more comforting than I anticipated. *We’ll get through this*.

*30 days earlier . . .*

I had decided to go all in on this new business I called “Gym Launch.” Here was the idea: I would fly around the country to gyms and fill them up to full capacity using this new methodology that hinged on an offer I had perfected when I owned my chain of gyms.

Leading up to this moment, I had sold five of my six gyms. The funds from selling them, my life’s work, I had put into an account I had with a new partner. This money was supposed to be the seed money for our new company.

*I was finally going to realize some level of success.*

My alarm went off. I groggily swung my arm over blindly clawing at the bedside table. I switched off the alarm, while Leila managed to sleep through the commotion.

I laid there silently, pulling up the bank accounts *―* a daily ritual. The balance said $300.

Wait. That couldn’t be right. There was $46,000 in here yesterday.

My adrenaline surged. Looking closer I saw “*-$45,700 Payment Successful.”* I was frantic.

The money from selling all of my gyms was gone. I checked where the money went. To my “partner.” He had taken all the money out.

*Fuck.*

The last four years of my life had vanished that fast. I officially had nothing, and even less to show for it. No gyms. No equipment. No employees. Nothing.

I felt dead inside.

Adding insult to injury, in that same 30-day period, my mother was in critical condition because of a near fatal accident (and was still under 24-hour supervision), and I had totalled my car in a head on collision at 60 miles per hour and earned a DUI as my consolation prize.

This was the cherry on top. My one saving grace during this time was selling a new “challenge offer” at a gym and collecting all the cash up front as my “fee” for turning their business around.

So I did the only thing I knew. I *sold*. My salesman had done $120,000 in a single month, and I owed him a $22,000 commission check.

The problem was the $120,000 never came.

“We need to talk,” I said as Leila and I went into the other room. I worked up the courage to speak but stared at the floor, embarrassed.

“I’ve got nothing,” I said to her. “I’m a sinking ship, and you don’t have to stay with me.”

She grabbed my chin and pulled my face towards hers so she could look into my eyes: “I would sleep with you under a bridge if it came to that.” I would have cried tears of joy, but I was so emotionally exhausted my response appeared apathetic.

*I wouldn’t stay with me*.

“Are we still gonna do these launches starting tomorrow?” She asked. “All my friends quit their jobs to do this.” She was being matter of fact, but it still stung. I felt defeated. “Listen, this could go horribly wrong, ”

“I trust you. We’ll figure it out.”

I had two things left at that point: a grand slam offer and an old business credit card with a $100,000 limit from when I had my gyms.

On the day after Christmas (two days after the gut-wrenching call with the payment processor) we were scheduled to launch six new gyms . . . at the same time. Between airfare, hotels, rental cars, gas, and ad spend (all multiplied by six), I was going to be spending $3,300 per *day* of money I didn’t have. My last dollar had gone to paying my salesman. I still remember my hand shaking as the advertisements went live: Off→ *ON.*

Just like that, I was going into debt at a rate of $412 dollars per working hour. Just like that, $3,300 per day began getting deducted from my account.

*-$3,300 . . . I now officially have nothing*

*-$3,300 . . . I now have officially less than nothing*

*-$3,300 . . . I have $10,000 less than nothing*

*-$3,300 . . . This one decision is going to ruin my future forever.*

But things started shaping up. Here’s what happened that month (January 2017), as documented by my old processing records I dug up. You can see the month along the left column and the revenue collected that month along the right.

We made $100,117! It was just enough to cover the $3,300/day that had been coming off the credit card. It was actually working. I could hardly believe it. I threw the hail mary, and the universe caught it. I went from looking up bankruptcy lawyers to figuring out what to do with $3,000,000 in profits, accrued within the first twelve months. It felt surreal. And in hindsight, it still kind of does.

By the end of the year we were doing $1,500,000+/mo. Twelve months from then, $4,400,000/mo. Per. Month. Twenty-four months after that, we crossed $120,000,000 in sales, donated $2,000,000 to help fund equal opportunity in low income areas. We met and befriended Arnold Swarzenegger (lifelong hero) and were asked to be board members of his charity *After School All Stars*.

*Leila and I meeting with Arnold Schwarzengger at his home. We are now on the national board of his charity After School All Stars. Creating Grand Slam Offers has given us access to people we only dreamed of.*

Twelve months after that, we now have a portfolio of seven eight-figure, and multi-eight-figure companies across a variety of industries (photography, publishing, fitness, business consulting, beauty) and business types (brick & mortar chains, software, service, e-commerce, training & education). Our portfolio companies now do about $1,600,000 *per* *week *(and growing).

I say this because I honestly can't believe it. All of this was because of a girl who believed in me, a credit card, and a Grand Slam Offer.

I know I teleported you from rags to riches. And the natural question is *how?* That’s what I’m going to use the rest of this book (and remaining books & free courses in this Acquisition.com series) to break down.

The skill of making offers saved me from bankruptcy and likely saved my life. I have made so many mistakes in my life. I’ve made so many bad life decisions. I’ve hurt people knowingly and mistakenly. I’ve done bad things with good intentions. I say this because I am human. I don’t pretend to have the answers. I have my own demons that I battle everyday. But, despite my many shortcomings, I’ve still managed to get really good at this *one *thing . . . and I’d like to share it with you. I can teach you how to build great offers.

I don’t know who you are (yes, you, the one reading this). But thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for allowing me to do work I find meaningful. Thank you for giving me your most valuable asset *―* your attention. I promise to do my best to give you a positive return on it.

Here is your first piece of good news: if you are reading this, then you are already in the top 10 percent. Most people buy stuff and then promptly ignore it. I can also throw out a spoiler: the further you get in the book, the bigger the nuggets become. Just watch.

This book delivers.

The world needs more entrepreneurs. It needs more fighters. It needs more magic. And that’s what I’m sharing with you *―* magic.
